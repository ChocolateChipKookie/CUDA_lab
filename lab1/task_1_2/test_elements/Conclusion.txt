When looking at the results ('plot_times.png'), as expected we can see that the time necessary for the processing is increasing with the increasing number of elements added.
If we look precisely at the average time needed per element ('plot_average.png') we can see that there is a dip at the 85000 elements mark, after which the times increase a bit where they remain steady. 
It looks like the optimal amount of blocks is around 335.

All the informations given can be found in the logs_* file and also in the other *.txt files
