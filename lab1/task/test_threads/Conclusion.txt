Looking at the sorted_output.txt file, it is obvious that the best solutions are 256 or 128 threads per block, where 256 threads per blocks takes the win.
Within the top contenders we see that almost all fastest configurations have a multiple of 32 threads.
In the end, when looking at the plot_without_first100.png(the first 100 have been taken out because they were exponentionally slower) we cann see a saw pattern emerging.
It looks like the worst configurations have n*32 + 1 threads per block.
