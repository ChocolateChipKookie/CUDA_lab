When trying to asses how many page faults we got by executing the programs, we got the following numbers:
GPU:
   no
CPU:
   384 page faults
GPU+CPU:
   403 page faults
CPU+GPU:
   407 page faults

After examining the unified memory tab in nvvp, there was an obvious trend.
	When profiling the gpu-only program, there was no data transfer, which implies that the reserved memory is on the device
	This fact is proven when executing the cpu-only program, as we see a device-to-host memory transfer
	Further experiments on GPU+CPU and CPU+GPU are as expected.
		GPU+CPU, there is only one device-to-host memory transfer
		CPU+GPU, there are 2 memory transfers, as firstly the data has to be transfered from the GPU to the CPU, where it will be handeled, after which it gets moved back to the device where the kernel is executed
